## Web Design Challenge

In this assignment, we were challenged to use data and visualizations
from a [previous assignment](https://github.com/swdrich/python-api-challenge) and html with Bootstrap to build and deploy a website to showcase our findings. 

I built my website using the [Paper Dashboard 2](https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-dashboard/docs/1.0/getting-started/introduction.html) template under an MIT license, and then further modified the CSS where necessary. 

The website is live and can be viewed at https://swdrich.github.io/web-design-challenge/index. It has 7 pages:

* /index - the landing page, which contains a summary of the project
* /weather_table - contains a table of the data used for the project
* /comparison - shows a layout of all four primary visualizations
* /temps - scatter plot and regression plot with analysis of        temperature data
* /humidity - scatter plot and regression plot with analysis of humidity data
* /clouds - scatter plot and regression plot with analysis of cloudiness data
* /wind - scatter plot and regression plot with analysis of wind speed data

Known issues remaining:
- [ ] Responsive icon for sidebar not working on weather_table page on mobile
